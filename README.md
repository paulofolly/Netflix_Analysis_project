# Is Netflix Still Worth It? A Data-Driven Exploration of My Viewing Habits
In this project, I will explore my own viewing habits on the Netflix platform. The analysis will focus on answering the following questions:

* What are the top 10 most viewed content by counting of views and by total hours viewed?

* What are my viewing habits, such as the day of the week, time of day, and part of the month I watch the most content, as well as identifying the show I watch the most?

* What is the cost per hour viewed per month, and is it really worth it for me to keep paying for Netflix?

Through this data analysis project, I aim to gain insights into my own Netflix consumption and draw meaningful conclusions from my viewing habits.
